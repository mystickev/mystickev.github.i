## BIO

A few details about me:
* I'm self-taught and it's in Cybersecurity, that I found the life-fulfilling, never-ending unquenchable fire. ;)
* I mainly focus on digital forensics, malware analysis/Reverse-engineering, Threat analysis, and Monitoring & Detection.
* I play CTFs with the international team [Fr334aks](https://twitter.com/fr334aks)
* I like to tinker with hardware sometimes, repair/modify stuff mostly.
* My background is in biochemistry and molecular biology.
* Sci-fi movies give me the 'endless possibilities' vibe.
* Interestingly, I read, research, and enjoy astrophysics stuff.
  
## Current Capabilities
