Hello! I'm [~mystik](https://twitter.com/Mystik_kev). I work as a cybersecurity researcher at [CYBERRANGES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyber-ranges/mycompany/), focusing on digital forensics, malware analysis, threat analysis, and monitoring & detection. Outside of work, I like to tinker with hardware, watch sci-fi, and read and enjoy astrophysics stuff among other topics.

I'm also a seasoned member of [Fr334aks](https://twitter.com/fr334aks), where I participate in challenges about forensics, OSINT, and reverse-engineering. Besides the cybersecurity stuff, I have a background in biochemistry and molecular biology.

My goal is to make this blog an information trove that will educate my readers. Thanks for reading my blog! Enjoy! :)
