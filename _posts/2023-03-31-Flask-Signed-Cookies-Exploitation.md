# Exploiting Signed Flask Cookies.

Flask uses a secure URL-safe signed serializer called "itsdangerous" to encode client-side session cookies. To prevent tampering by the client, the Flask app utilizes a secret key to sign the session cookie.

Although the session cookie may appear to be a sequence of random characters, it is actually easy to decode with the appropriate key.
In this blog, we will look at how flask application cookies can be modified to grant different authentication-level privileges.

## Exploitation Phase:

Our web application successfully authenticates into any account and creates a cookie for the sign-on. The web application is made with a flask backend which means the cookies will be flask signed.
These cookies may seem similar to JWT tokens but are not JWT tokens. The flask session package tracks, stores, and validates the session cookies.
When using sessions, the data is typically stored in the browser as a cookie, referred to as the session cookie. 
Unlike a regular cookie, Flask employs cryptographic signing to secure the session cookie. This implies that although the contents of the cookie can be seen, it can't be altered without the secret key utilized to sign it. Hence, it's advisable to use a lengthy and intricate string as the secret key.
Upon setting the session cookie, all subsequent server requests authenticate the cookie's validity by using the same secret key to decode it. If Flask is unable to decrypt the cookie, its contents are disregarded, and a new session cookie is issued to the browser.

Here, our test web application creates a flask cookie during authentication to the server.
